## * Problems that we encountered
❗️The car mesh imported from Blender did not apply properly to the car. This had to be worked around by using the mesh of the prototype car, but the model of the final car. <br>
❗️The Logitech GSDK only works on Vincent's computer. This issue was never resolved. <br>
❗️The car physics had many issues: the brake force, reverse gear, power delivery, etc. all required a lot of time and effort to get working. <br>
❗️Extremely long build times. <br>
❗️<del> It worked well when we connected with two laptops without using the VR headset and the steering wheel or when we pressed the play button on Unity with the Oculus Quest 2 and the Logitech Steering wheel connected to the same laptop. However, every time we tried to do the simulator, we couldn't figure out how to sync the Oculus with the steering wheel without the cable connected to the laptop. </del> <br>
✅ The last problem found out to be the wifi problem not from the code or the network problem. So, If the wifi is good enough, everything works well.
